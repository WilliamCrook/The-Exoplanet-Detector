mode:title:WELCOME:
Welcome to the Exoplanet Detector, this a tool that can perform automatic detection and analysis of transiting exoplanets orbiting around distant stars using data from the 
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). This program offers two modes: Single Target mode and Multiple Targets mode. Single Target mode allows for in-depth analysis 
of exoplanets around a single specified star, plotting relevant graphs and a 3D model of the system. Multiple Targets mode allows for quick analysis of multiple stars for the 
mass detection of exoplanets.

new paragraph
Both modes will calculate many parameters of the exoplanets detected, including but not limited to the exoplanets orbital period, mass, planetary radius, orbital radius and 
whether it falls within the habitable zone of its host star. Below is a help section to hopefully answers any questions you have!

mode:title:WHAT IS TESS?:not super
The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a satellite launched by NASA designed to search for planets outisde our solar system using the transit method. TESS was 
launched on 18th April 2018 with an inital mission brief of surveying 200,000 stars over the course of two years. This prime mission ended on the 4th July 2020. TESS 
surveys the sky by breaking it up into 24 x 96 degree sectors observing each for at least 27 days [1].

mode:title:WHAT IS AN EXOPLANET?:not super
An exoplanet refers to any planet not in our solar system or in other words orbiting around a star which is not our own.

mode:title:WHAT IS THE TRANSIT METHOD?:not super
The transit method is a way of detecting exoplanets. As exoplanets pass betweent they're host star and Earth they partially block out light from this star, in the same way the 
moon blocks light from the sun during an eclipse, but much less severe. This small drop in light (drop in flux) can be detected [2]. We can determine many parameters of the 
exoplanet from this simple measurement, such as its orbital period by measuring the time between the drops in flux. This method does however mean we are limited to 
detecting exoplanets which have orbits that pass between the line of sight of their host star and Earth.

mode:title:WHAT IS A LIGHT CURVE?:not super
In the case of this program, light curves are graphs of visible light intensity over time for a star, this program gets this data from TESS.

mode:title:WHAT IS A PERIODOGRAM?:not super
A periodogram is an estimate of the spectral density of a signal. This allows for the periodic natural of a light curve to be determined, allowing for this program to extract the 
transits of an exoplanet from the general signal from its host star [3].

mode:title:WHAT ARE THE FFI, SPOC AND TESS-SPOC PIPELINES?:super
TESS records data in multiple different ways the main of which being Full Frame Images (FFI), this is a picture of all the star visible in the current sector of focus, this images 
can be cropped around a specific star to recover the flux data for only that star. FFI are taken every 30 minutes for sectors 1 - 26 and every 10 minutes for every sector afterwards [4]. 
The Science Processing Operations Centre (SPOC) pipeline is a NASA pipeline featuring images with a 2 minute exposure [5]. These images have also been processed to remove any 
errors caused by TESS momentum dumps and to reduce the noise from the baseline flux of the star. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite Science Processing Operation Centre 
(TESS-SPOC) is similar to SPOC in terms of noise processing but its images have an exposure time of 10 minutes. Having a shorter exposure time leads to more data and better results 
when looking for exoplanets so why bother with FFI? The reason is not every star has been put throught the SPOC and TESS-SPOC pipeline, therefore being able to use FFIs allows much 
more data to be analysised. Furthermore this code was designed for FFIs and in some instances the high data count in the SPOC and TESS-SPOC pipelines lead to increased noise making
it hard for the code to correctly pick out the transits.

mode:title:HOW EXOPLANETS ARE DETECTED?:not super
The code makes use of the Lightkurve package to download target pixel file cutouts of full frame images using the tesscut function or downloads the light curves from the SPOC 
and TESS-SPOC pipelines, depending on which is required. For speed a data base has been created by mass downloading all stars with known transiting exoplanets obsevered
by TESS, this data base is not needed to run the code but will cause it to run alot slower. In both single target and multiple targets mode 
the code will download or find from the database the required star and perform analysis. The code removes anamlous results or errors caused by TESS momentum dumps from 
the data and then searches for transits. It does this be first taking a periodogram of the whole data set to determine possible periods. The data is then flipped and the the find_peaks 
function from the scipy package is used to find transits. The different transits are groups based on their average drop in flux in order to separate the transits of different exoplanets.
For each possible period, the different branches and routes between the transits are searched to find the best match. These diffferent routes are compared to one another and the most 
likely set of transit points are returned. The periodogram is then replotted over plus and minus 20% of this period. This is done as it gives a more accurate period than 
the estimate due to the higher resolution. 
new paragraph
new paragraph
To ensure that the detected exoplanet is not due errors the code folds the lightcurve about its transit points and analysis its shape to make sure it forms a smooth curve. This does not 
mean however this code is 100% accurate, it does unfortunately make mistakes, whether it be from missing exoplanets that do exist or from false positives. This program is not 
designed as a research level quotable source, DO NOT use it as such! This is an experiment into what can be achieved without any human input.

mode:title:HOW PARAMETERS ARE CALCULATED?:not super
This section describes how the calculated values are obtained.
new paragraph
new paragraph
The orbital radius is found by rearranging Kepler's third law which states that the square of the period of any planet is proportional to the cube 
of the semimajor axis of its orbit [6].

create equation
where G is the Gravitational constant, M is the mass of the star, P is the orbital period.
new paragraph
new paragraph
The orbital velocity of the planet is determined by using the uniform circular motion equation and assumes that the planet is travelling in a perfectly circular orbit.

create equation
where P is the orbital period and a is the semi major axis of the orbit.
new paragraph
new paragraph
The radius of planet is found from the square root of the drop in flux which is proportional to the ratio of the planetary radius and the radius of the star [7].

create equation
where deltaL/L is the drop in flux of the star, R* is the stellar radius.
new paragraph
new paragraph
The transit duration is found using Sackett's method in 1998 [8] where the distance between the centre of the star and the planet is less than the sum of the radii of the two which
means that the duration of the transit is equal to a fraction of the orbital period. More on this can be found on page 7-8 at https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9811269.pdf

create equation
where R* is the stellar radius, P is the orbital period, a is the semi major axis of the orbit
new paragraph
new paragraph
Planetary mass calculation stems from the law of conservation of momentum between the planet and its parent star. Using the orbital radius equation (1.1) 
and the orbital velocity equation (1.2), an approximated value for the planetary mass is found [9], and eccentricity is introduced as the final part of the equation to account
for the elliptical orbit as described by Kepler's first law.

create equation
where P is the orbital period, G is the gravitational constant, v* is the radial velocity of the star, M is the stellar mass, and Epsilon is the eccentricity of the orbit.
new paragraph
new paragraph
Planetary density is calculated by using the mass divided volume equation where the volume is that of the planet.

create equation
where mp is the mass of the planet, and Rp is the radius of the planet.
new paragraph
new paragraph
Surface gravity is found from equating Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation to Newton's second law [10].

create equation
where mp is the mass of the planet, and Rp is the radius of the planet.
new paragraph
new paragraph
The surface temperature of the planet is calculated by assuming that the planet is acting as a black body and therefore, it is in an energy balance
where the energy absorbed is equal to the energy radiated [11].

create equation
where L is the stellar luminosity, sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and a is the semi major axis of the orbit. 
new paragraph
new paragraph
The habitable zone is determined by using the proportionality between T^4 and r^-2 [12]. The upper limit uses the boiling point of water (373K) because this is the greatest distance
away from a star where water can exist. The lower limits uses the freezing point of water (273K) because this is the shortest distance away from a star that water can exist. With these
bounds in place, any planet located between this region will be within the habitable zone of their star.

create equation
where a is the semi major axis of the orbit T0 is the surface temperature of the planet and T is either 273K or 373K depending on the limit being calculated.
new paragraph
new paragraph
All of the stellar parameters needed to perform the calculations using the equations above, have been found using the MAST portal queries and the eccentricity values have 
been found using NASA Exoplanet archive queries.
